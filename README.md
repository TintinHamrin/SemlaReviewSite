<h1>Let's talk about...Semlor!</h1>
<h2>A Semla Review Site</h2><br>

<b>🎯 Goals:</b><br>
Create a website for all the semla-lovers out there. The user can read and post reviews on semlor across the country. The user can like other peoples reviews and save them to a list. To write a review the user will have to create an account with email and password. The registered user will have a profile page where they can show information about themselves, like a collection of their reviews, their favorite semla. 

<b>👨‍🎓 Learnings:</b><br>
Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend.<br>
Learned how to set up and incorporate a backend server to frontend using Node.js/Express.<br>
Developed my understanding of noSQL database (Firebase).<br> Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit).<br>
I've used Material UI for design and accessability concerns and SCSS when needing to override styles.<br> I've used Github for version controll managing as well as code reviewing with peers.<br>
The app is bootstrapped with Create react App.
