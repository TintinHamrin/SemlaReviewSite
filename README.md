# Let's talk about...Semlor!
## A Semla Review Site

### ***🎯 Goals:***
Create a website for all the semla-lovers out there. The user can read and post reviews on semlor across the country. 
The user can like other peoples reviews and save them to a list. 
To write a review the user will have to create an account with email and password. 
The registered user will have a profile page where they can show information about themselves, like a collection of their reviews, their favorite semla. 

### ***👨‍🎓 Learnings:***
Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend.
Learned how to set up and incorporate a backend server to frontend using Node.js/Express.
Developed my understanding of noSQL database (Firebase). 
Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit).
I've used Material UI for design and accessability concerns and SCSS when needing to override styles.
I've used Github for version controll managing as well as code reviewing with peers.
The app is bootstrapped with Create react App.
